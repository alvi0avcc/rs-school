  <h2>Transcription</h2>
  <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my self-presentation</p>
  <p>My name is Alexander Vavilov, I am 46 years old. I'm from Berdyansk on the â€‹â€‹Azov sea. In 2001, I graduated from the
  Ukrainian State Marine Technical University (currently the National University of Shipbuilding) with a degree in Ships
  and Ocean Engineering. I'm a shipbuilding engineer.</p>
  <p>I've been interested in programming since school (as far as it was possible in those days).</p>
  <p>The first computer at the school was "Pravets-8A and the programming language - BASIC".
  </p>
  <P>At the university I studied Pascal and its reincarnation in Delphi. As part of the university, he took part in the development of software for shipbuilding.</P>
  <p>After university, he worked in shipbuilding for 6 years. He started as an ordinary engineer and progressed to the head of a project team.</p>
  <p>Programming did not remain on the sidelines (albeit at the hobby level); in parallel with work, I completed training at the "Computer Academy "STEP"" in C++.</p>
  <p>At a corporate event, a colleague remarked that, as a manager, I might be losing my engineering skills over time. He
  proposed testing my abilities by sending my resume to a random recruitment agency as a sort of bet. I accepted the
  challenge, and as a result, I secured a job as a technical inspector at the international technical society Bureau
  Veritas LLC.
  </p>
  <p>And as a result of the experiment, I get a job as a technical inspector at the international technical society "Bureau Veritas LLC".</p>
  <p>I worked in this field for 15 years. The first 5 years as an employee.
    And later he organized his own company with a staff of about 50 people,
    providing contract monitoring and consulting services in the field of automation of audit and implementation processes ISO 17020 (this standard sets out requirements for the competence of bodies carrying out inspections, as well as for the impartiality and
    sequence of their inspection activities) as a subcontractor for companies such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://group.bureauveritas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau Veritas</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sgs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SGS</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.controlunion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control Union</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>But, unfortunately, this direction is currently not possible in our region.</p>
  <p>From my point of view, this is not a reason to give up, but rather a reason to rethink the situation and find a new application for your knowledge.</p>
  <p>Since I have some experience in independently setting up and administering file-server and web-server running Linux systems.
    I started my own project to automate the processes of determining the amount of cargo (in bulk) in warehouses.</p>
  <p>The idea was to develop an application that was platform independent and could function offline in places without
  internet access.</p>
  <a href="https://avcc.sytes.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AVCC - Private project. Testing platform</a>
  <p>I managed to implement the client side using React.</p>
  <p>This was my first experience developing a web application.</p>
  <p>Algorithms were developed and implemented for approximating basic measurements of heaps of cargo into real models,
  followed by calculations of their mutual intersection to calculate the total volume of cargo.</p>
  <p>WebGL was used for 3D visualization of the modeling process and the final result.</p>
  <p>At the moment, the project is on pause, as I decided to complete my studies and fill in the gaps in knowledge.
    Otherwise, it turns out to be a bit crooked to develop a web application without first studying HTML and CSS ðŸ˜‰</p>
  <p>Therefore, I took online courses on website development at Tomsk State University,
    after finishing which one of the teachers recommended that I continue my studies here at "RS-School".</p>
  <p>Thank you for your time and for putting up with my terrible English..</p>
  <p>Best regards, Aleksander.</p>
