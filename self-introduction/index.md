## Transcription

Hello everyone, and welcome to my self-presentation.

My name is Alexander Vavilov, and I am 46 years old. I am from Berdyansk, on the Azov Sea. In 2001, I graduated from the Ukrainian State Marine Technical University (now the National University of Shipbuilding) with a degree in Ships and Ocean Engineering. I am a shipbuilding engineer.

I have been interested in programming since school (as far as it was possible in those days). The first computer at my school was the Pravets-8A, and the programming language was BASIC.

At university, I studied Pascal and its successor, Delphi. As part of my studies, I participated in the development of software for shipbuilding.

After university, I worked in shipbuilding for six years. I started as a regular engineer and eventually became the head of a project team.

Although programming remained a hobby, I continued my education and completed training in C++ at the Computer Academy "STEP."

At a corporate event, a colleague remarked that, as a manager, I might be losing my engineering skills over time. He proposed testing my abilities by sending my resume to a random recruitment agency as a sort of bet. I accepted the challenge, and as a result, I secured a job as a technical inspector at the international technical society Bureau Veritas LLC.

I worked in this field for 15 years—the first five as an employee. Later, I established my own company with a staff of about 50 people, providing contract monitoring and consulting services in automating audit and implementation processes according to ISO 17020 (a standard that sets out requirements for the competence of inspection bodies, as well as for the impartiality and sequence of their activities). We served companies such as:

- Bureau Veritas
- SGS
- Control Union

Unfortunately, this line of work is currently not feasible in our region. In my view, however, this is not a reason to give up but an opportunity to rethink the situation and apply my knowledge in new ways.

Having gained experience in setting up and administering file and web servers running on Linux systems, I started my own project to automate the process of determining the amount of bulk cargo in warehouses. The goal was to develop a platform-independent application that could function offline in areas without internet access.

#### AVCC – Private Project (Testing Platform):
[https://avcc.sytes.net/](https://avcc.sytes.net/)

I managed to implement the client side using React. This was my first experience in developing a web application.

I developed and implemented algorithms to approximate the basic measurements of cargo heaps and convert them into realistic models. I then calculated their mutual intersections to determine the total volume of cargo. WebGL was used for 3D visualization of both the modeling process and the final result.

At the moment, the project is on hold while I complete my studies and fill in gaps in my knowledge. After all, it would be unwise to develop a web application without first studying HTML and CSS.

Therefore, I took online courses in website development at Tomsk State University, and upon completion, one of the teachers recommended that I continue my studies here at RS-School.

Thank you for your time and for bearing with my imperfect English.

##### Best regards,
##### Aleksandr.
